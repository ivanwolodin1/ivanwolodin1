### 👨‍🔬 About me
- Currently working as a **researcher**, writing my **PhD thesis** (and yes, coffee is my co-author ☕)  
- Former **backend developer**, with a sprinkle of frontend adventures  
- (Trying to!) build a bridge between **LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method)** and **thin film dynamics modeling**  

---

### 🛠 My (surviving) tech stack:
- **Backend:** Python (sometimes friend, sometimes foe)  
- **Frontend:** JS, ReactJS (just enough to be dangerous)  
- **Science:** NumPy, Matplotlib, C++ (with no harsh stuff) a couple of wild equations and lots of hope

### 🎢 Fun facts:
- I write code and papers at about the same speed: **slowly, but with tears of joy**  
- Love it when simulations work; **hate it** when NaN appear  
- Firm believer that **LBM is magic and thin films are art**
