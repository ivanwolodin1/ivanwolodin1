## Hi there 👋

*Researcher by day, ~~superhero~~ software developer by night!*

### 👨‍🔬 About me
- Currently working as a **researcher**, writing my **PhD thesis** (The samurai has only the path 😢)  
- Former **backend developer**, with a sprinkle of frontend adventures  
- (Trying to!) build a bridge between **LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method)** and **thin film dynamics modeling**
- **FIDE Master (FM) in chess** — applying strategic thinking and discipline from the board to science.

---

### 🛠 My (surviving) tech stack:
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, sqlmodel 
- **Frontend:** JS, ReactJS (just enough to be dangerous)  
- **Science:** C++ (with no harsh stuff), NumPy, Matplotlib, little Fortran (hi olds!), a couple of wild equations and lots of hope

### 🎢 Fun facts:
- I write code and papers at about the same speed: **slowly, but with tears of joy**  
- Love it when simulations work; **hate it** when NaN appear  
- Scientifically speaking, **LBM** often *feels* like magic, and **thin films** are nothing short of *art*.
